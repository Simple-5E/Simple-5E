* Character creation
* Character stat and ability management
* Spell book management

* Clean, distraction-free interface

## Staying Simple

Simple 5E will never be a fully featured app in favour of remaining light and intuitive. Besides, there are several
great 5E apps out there anyway!

* [the DND Beyond Player App](https://www.dndbeyond.com/player-app)
* [5e Spells (Android)](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.dungeondev.a5espells&hl=en-US)
* [5e Spells (iOS)](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/spells-list-5e/id1220380339)
